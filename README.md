# Physician-Prescribing-Patterns

Currently a work in progress. Expected completion June 25th.


The goal of this project is to explore prescribing patterns of physicians and correlations between geographic regions and/or institutions.
To answer these questions, I will be using the Medicare Part D Prescriber data and Medicare Physician Compare data.
