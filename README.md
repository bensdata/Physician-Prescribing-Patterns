# Physician-Prescribing-Patterns

Currently a work in progress. Expected completion June 25th.

For my project, I am exploring why North Dakota has higher use of antipsychotic drugs. I was alerted to this by Probuclica's exploration of Medicare prescriber data (see here: https://projects.propublica.org/checkup/). I decided to explore further into the North Dakota's use of antipsychotics. Specifically, what providers types are prescribing them and are there hospitals that are linked?

To answer this, I used the following 2 datasets:
  Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: 2017 Part D Prescriber (https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Part-D/Medicare-Provider-Utilization-and-Payment-Data-201/77gb-8z53)
  Physician Data (https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6)
